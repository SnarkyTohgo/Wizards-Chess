# Wizards Chess in C

Chess engine made entirely in C language for a university class (Computer Labs). The engine was developed for Linux and all the firmware was done by me from scratch, which means all of the hardware component's 
(video card, sound card, mouse, keyboard, timer, etc)  integration were programmed by hand so as to have better control over what happens in each hardware interruption (and how it happens). The game only runs 
on a version of Linux called Minix which allows for easier hardware manipulation, and was run using a virtual machine with Vbox.

This project was developed with â™¥ by *Tiago Lima Rocha*
